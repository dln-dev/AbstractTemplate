# AbstractTemplate
## Template for Abstracts (Conference submissions etc.)

Adjust preamble with your metadata (and layout choice), write text, create your bib-file, cite.
Then "make" and enjoy.

ToDo:  
create flexible author arrangement for arbitrarily many authors (up to cutoff)  
create switches for different layouts and bib backends  
fix errors  
find nice and appropriate citation styles  
  
Errors:  
metadata in PDF not UTF-8  
references in compressed PDF get deleted
